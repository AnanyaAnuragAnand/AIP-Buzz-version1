# ðŸ§¬ AIPID: Anti-Inflammatory Peptide Identification App

AIPID is a machine learning-based Streamlit web application designed to predict whether a given peptide sequence has anti-inflammatory properties. The model is trained on curated peptide datasets using a Random Forest classifier with features derived from Biopython and Propy3 descriptors.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Paste a peptide sequence with at least 10 amino acids** using single-letter amino acid codes.
- **Predicts anti-inflammatory activity** based on trained ML model.
- Displays **prediction confidence score**.
- Clean, interactive **multi-page app** with About, Help, and Contact pages.
- Deployed via **Streamlit Cloud**.
